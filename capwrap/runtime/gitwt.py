"""Per-container git checkouts for ``mode = "worktree"``.

Overlaying a git repo works, but it leaves you reconciling agents by diffing
overlay upper directories.  Giving each agent its own branch in its own worktree
means integration is an ordinary ``git merge``.

Two sharing policies:

``share = "objects"``
    A real ``git worktree`` off the source repo.  One object store, branches
    visible from the host repo immediately.  The main ``.git`` is mounted into
    the sandbox, so an agent can in principle touch another agent's refs -- this
    is the fast, cooperative mode.

``share = "none"``
    ``git clone --local``: a self-contained repo with hardlinked objects.  No
    shared writable state at all.  Integrate with ``git fetch <path> <branch>``
    from the source repo.

The absolute-path problem
-------------------------
A linked worktree is glued to its repo by two files holding *host* absolute
paths:

* ``<worktree>/.git``                        -> ``gitdir: <main>/.git/worktrees/<id>``
* ``<main>/.git/worktrees/<id>/gitdir``      -> ``<worktree>/.git``

Inside the sandbox the main repo lives at ``/gitdir/<slug>``, not at its host
path, so the first file does not resolve and git reports the famously unhelpful
"not a git repository".

We fix only the first file, and we fix it *without touching the host copy*: a
rewritten version is staged in the container's state directory and bind-mounted
over ``<dest>/.git``.  The host's copy stays correct, so ``git -C <worktree>``
still works from the host after the container is gone.

The second file is deliberately left alone.  It is read by ``git worktree
list`` and ``git worktree prune``, both of which run on the *host*, where the
recorded path is the correct one.  Rewriting it would make the host believe the
worktree had vanished and prune it out from under a running agent.
