"""Mounting into the namespaces of a *running* container.

`SharedDirMapper` (the default) materialises a dataspace by copying or linking
it into a host directory that is already bind-mounted into the sandbox. That
works everywhere and needs no privilege, but it is not a mount: the two
containers do not end up looking at the same filesystem object, and a directory
cannot be aliased at all.

This module does the real thing. The sequence is:

1. **On the host**, `open_tree(src, OPEN_TREE_CLONE | AT_RECURSIVE)` detaches a
   copy of the source mount tree and hands back a file descriptor for it. This
   has to happen first, because once we enter the container's mount namespace
   the host's filesystem is no longer reachable by path -- bwrap pivot_root'd
   away from it. A detached mount fd survives the namespace switch; a path does
   not.
2. **Fork**, because `setns` is one-way; the parent has to stay where it is.
3. `setns(pidfd, CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNS)` -- both namespaces in a single
   call. Joining them one at a time fails with EPERM: `mntns_install` checks
   `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` against the user namespace recorded in the *pending*
   credential set, so the user namespace has to be applied in the same
   operation rather than before it.
4. `move_mount(tree_fd, "", AT_FDCWD, dest, MOVE_MOUNT_F_EMPTY_PATH)` attaches
   the detached tree at its destination inside the container.

Privilege
---------
This needs `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` **on the host**, which an ordinary user does not
have. An unprivileged daemon can still join the container's namespaces and even
reads back a full capability set there -- but `mount(2)` and `open_tree(2)`
still return EPERM, because the check is made against the user namespace that
owns the *source* mount namespace, and that is the host's.

Measured on this host: as an ordinary user every mount attempt inside a joined
container returns EPERM; as root, the identical code succeeds. So this backend
is real, and `available()` reports whether the daemon can actually use it rather
than guessing from a version number.
