"""How a delegated dataspace actually reaches the container that was given it.

`CapKernel.ds_map` decides *whether* one container may hand a dataspace to
another. What happens as a result is a `Mapper`, and there are two, with
genuinely different semantics:

`SharedDirMapper`
    Copies or symlinks into the target's `/shared`, which is a plain host
    directory already bound into the sandbox. Needs no privilege and works
    everywhere, but it is not a mount: `mode="map"` degrades to a symlink, which
    only resolves if the target is itself inside the bind.

`NsMountMapper`
    A real bind mount into the running container's mount namespace. True
    aliasing -- both containers look at the same filesystem objects, writes on
    one side appear on the other, and a directory can be mapped as a directory.
    Requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` on the host, so the daemon has to be privileged.

`select` picks the strongest one the daemon can actually use, by trying it.
