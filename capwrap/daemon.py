"""The daemon: the kernel's hands.

`CapKernel` decides what is permitted; `Daemon` is what actually happens as a
result.  It owns the sandboxes, the PTYs, the mailboxes and the per-container
sockets, and it implements the kernel's `Hooks` protocol.

The socket layout is the security-relevant part.  Each container gets its own
`AF_UNIX` socket, bound on the host at ``<state>/containers/<name>/agent.sock``
and bind-mounted into the sandbox at ``/run/capwrap.sock``.  When a connection
arrives, the daemon already knows which container it came from, because it knows
which socket accepted it.  Nothing in the request establishes identity, so there
is nothing an agent can lie about.
