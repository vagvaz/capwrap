"""The capability kernel: every privileged operation in capwrap goes through here.

Design rules, in order of importance:

1. **No ambient authority.**  Every operation names its subject by a slot in the
   caller's own capability table.  There is no "by name" variant, anywhere.  An
   agent cannot act on a container it was not given a capability for, because it
   has no way to refer to one.

2. **Authority only ever shrinks.**  Delegation goes through the mapping
   database, which refuses to hand on rights the delegator does not hold.  This
   applies to spawning too: a container created through a factory gets its
   initial capabilities *derived from the spawner's*, so an agent cannot mint a
   child with more authority than it has itself.  Skipping this would make
   `factory` a hole big enough to drive the whole system through.

3. **The kernel performs no I/O.**  Sending a message, killing a process and
   copying a file are effects; the kernel decides whether they are permitted and
   then calls a hook.  That keeps policy testable without a sandbox, a daemon or
   a filesystem, and keeps the audit log honest, since every decision passes one
   choke point.

        it, and three things have to happen together or the model breaks:

        1. Everything it held is revoked, recursively, as on destroy.

           `cap.list` would quietly skip it while the slot stayed occupied, and
           invoking it would fail as an internal error rather than a clean denial.
        3. Its children are reparented to its own parent. The tree is built by
           walking down from the roots, so a child whose parent has vanished is
