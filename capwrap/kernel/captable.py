"""Per-task capability tables.

A `Task` is one principal in the system: a container, or the operator (the
`root` task, which the web UI acts as).  Its capability table maps small
integers -- *slots* -- to `CapRef`s.

Slots are local names.  Agent A's slot 3 and agent B's slot 3 have nothing to do
with each other, and neither agent can say anything about an object it does not
hold a slot for.  This is the difference between a capability system and an
access-control list: authority travels with the reference, so there is no
ambient namespace to be enumerated or guessed at.
