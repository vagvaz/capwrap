"""The mapping database: who gave what to whom, and how to take it back.

Straight out of L4.  Every capability a task holds is a node in a forest.  Roots
are capabilities the kernel minted directly (held by the operator); every other
node was derived from its parent by delegation.

Two invariants do all the work:

**Monotonicity.**  A child's rights are a subset of its parent's.  Authority can
only ever shrink as it spreads, so the rights any task can possibly obtain are
bounded by the rights on the path back to a root.  You can read a container's
maximum possible authority off the tree without simulating the system.

**Recursive revocation.**  Revoking a node revokes its entire subtree.  When you
take a capability back from agent A, everything A passed on dies with it --
including things A gave to agents you have never heard of.  Without this, a
capability system leaks authority permanently on the first delegation, and
"revoke" becomes a lie.

The tree is the reason delegation is safe to allow at all.  Agents can hand each
other authority freely, because the operator holds the root and one `revoke`
unwinds the whole thing.
