"""PreToolUse hook: route an agent's permission prompts to the operator's inbox.

Registered inside a sandbox as a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook.  Claude runs it
before every tool call and waits for its verdict, so this is where a prompt that
would otherwise appear in the agent's own terminal gets diverted to the capwrap
web UI instead.

That is the point of the whole approval feature: with five agents running you do
not want five terminals each blocking on their own y/n prompt.  They all queue
in one list, and answering there unblocks the agent that asked.

Protocol, from the installed `claude`'s own documentation:

    stdin   {"hook_event_name": "PreToolUse", "tool_name": ..., "tool_input": {...},
             "session_id": ..., "cwd": ...}
    stdout  {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
                                    "permissionDecision": "allow"|"deny"|"ask",
                                    "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}

Failure is deliberately *not* silent-allow: if the daemon cannot be reached we
return "ask", which falls back to Claude's own prompt.  A hook that defaulted to
"allow" when broken would quietly disable every permission check in the system.
