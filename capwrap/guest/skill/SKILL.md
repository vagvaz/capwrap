description: Talk to other agents and to the human operator from inside a capwrap container. Use when you need to message another agent, share files with one, ask the operator for permission or a decision, check what you are allowed to do, or start a helper container. Triggers on "message the other agent", "ask the operator", "what am I allowed to do", "share this with", "spawn a helper".

# Working inside a capwrap container

You are running in a sandbox. You cannot see the host filesystem, other agents'
files, or anything you were not explicitly given. Everything you *can* do
outside your own filesystem goes through one command: `capctl`.

## What you hold

```
capctl caps
```

Lists your **capabilities**. Each is a numbered slot with a label and a set of
rights:

```
SLOT  KIND       LABEL       RIGHTS
1     container  self        delegate,inspect,kill,read_output,send,signal
2     gate       operator    inspect,send
3     dataspace  /ref        delegate,map,read
4     container  peer:dev-b  inspect,send
```

You can refer to a capability by slot number or by label — `capctl send 4 "hi"`
and `capctl send peer:dev-b "hi"` are the same thing. **You cannot name anything
you do not hold a capability for.** If a command fails with `no_such_cap`, you
were not given that authority; do not try to work around it, ask the operator.

## Asking the human

Two different things need two different channels.

**A conversation** — design questions, a grill, clarifications, anything with
more than a yes or a no in it: stay in your own harness. End your turn with
the questions, numbered, and the operator answers right here in your terminal.
On claude, `AskUserQuestion` does the same natively — capwrap lets it through
untouched, so its picker renders in this terminal. Do **not** route a
conversation through `capctl ask`: the operator's queue is for permissions,
and a design discussion there becomes a pile of cards nobody can answer well.

**A decision** — you are mid-task, blocked on a yes/no, and ending your turn
would lose the work in flight:

```
capctl ask "May I add a dependency on requests?"
```

Blocks until the operator answers in their console, then exits 0 for allow and
non-zero for deny — so `capctl ask "..." && do-the-thing` does the right thing.
Keep these rare and batched: one ask carrying several sub-questions beats five
interrupts. Batch multiple questions into a single ask rather than asking one
at a time.

## Asking for a capability you do not have

`capctl ask` is only a question — the operator saying "allow" tells you yes but
changes nothing. If you need *authority* you do not hold, request it:

```
capctl request factory --quota 2 --reason "need a helper to run the test suite"
capctl request container dev-b --rights send,inspect --reason "report results"
capctl request dataspace /srv/data --rights read
```

Approving the request performs the grant, so on success the capability is
already in your table and usable immediately — check with `capctl caps`. The
operator may give you narrower rights than you asked for; the command prints
what you actually got and exits non-zero if it was refused.

Naming a container here is not cheating: you are asking a human, and they decide.
It is asking to *act* on something you hold no capability for that is impossible.

## Talking to other agents

```
capctl send peer:dev-b "I've pushed the parser fix to capwrap/dev-a"
capctl recv                  # read your mailbox
capctl recv --wait           # block until something arrives
```

Messages also appear as files in `/shared/inbox/`, so check there if you were
not watching. Needs `send` on that peer.

## Watching and driving another agent

With `read_output` on a peer you can see its terminal; with `write_input` you
can type at it. Together they let you drive an agent through an interactive
prompt it cannot answer any other way.

```
capctl screen peer:helper                 # what is it showing right now?
capctl type peer:helper "run the tests"   # text, no Enter
capctl type peer:helper "yes" --enter     # text then Enter
capctl keys peer:helper down down enter   # arrows, Tab, Escape, ctrl-c ...
```

`capctl keys` exists because a selection prompt is answered with arrow keys and
Enter, and none of those are characters you can type. Enter sends a carriage
return, which is what a terminal actually delivers -- a newline is often ignored.

Read the screen again after each keystroke rather than sending a whole sequence
blind: you are driving a program that redraws, and what is highlighted after one
keypress tells you whether the next one is right.

These are two separate rights, and neither comes with `inspect`. Knowing a
container exists is much less than reading everything on its screen.

## Sharing files with another agent

```
capctl map peer:dev-b 3 findings --mode copy
```

Puts the dataspace in slot 3 into that agent's `/shared/findings`. `--mode copy`
duplicates the bytes and needs the `copy` right; `--mode map` aliases them and
needs the stronger `map` right.

## Passing on authority

```
capctl grant peer:dev-b 3 --rights read
```

Gives another agent one of your own capabilities. **You can only ever give away
rights you hold, and only if your capability has `delegate`.** Prefer granting
the smallest useful subset.

```
capctl revoke 3
```

Takes back everything you granted from slot 3 — recursively, including anything
the recipient passed on further. Add `--self-too` to drop your own copy as well.

## Starting a helper

```
capctl spawn factory /shared/child-config.json
```

Only if you hold a `factory` capability, and only within its quota. The child
starts with **no more authority than you have**, and only what its config asks
for and you can actually grant.

You also get a capability **on** the child, labelled `child:<name>`, so you can
reach what you created:

```
capctl spawn factory /shared/child.json
  spawned helper (1 left in the factory)
  you hold it in slot 4 as child:helper with inspect,send

capctl send child:helper "start with the parser tests"
```

How much you get is fixed by your factory, not by you -- `capctl caps` shows it.
If it includes `read_output` and `write_input` you can watch and drive the child
(see above); if it grants nothing, you cannot reach the child at all and have to
ask the operator.

## Etiquette

- Check `capctl caps` before assuming you can do something.
- Ask the operator rather than guessing, and rather than working around a denial.
- When you finish a piece of work, tell the agents who depend on it.
- Your git branch is yours alone; commit freely, nobody else sees your worktree.
